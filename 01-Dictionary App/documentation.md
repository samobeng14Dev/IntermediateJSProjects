## Vanilla JS Dictionary App Documentation

### Introduction
The Vanilla JS Dictionary App is a simple web application that allows users to search for a word and retrieve its definition, audio pronunciation, and phonetic value. The app utilizes an API to fetch the word information and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Additionally, there are three buttons that can be used to display the meaning of the word in a separate container.

### Features
1. Word Search: Users can enter a word in the input field and press the Enter key to fetch its information from the API.
2. Word Display: The fetched word, audio pronunciation, and phonetic value are displayed in a container on the page.
3. Meaning Display: The app provides three buttons (Definition, Synonym, and Example) that can be clicked to display the corresponding meaning of the word in a separate container.
4. Error Handling: If the entered word is not found in the API, an error message is displayed to notify the user.

### Usage

2. Fetch Information: The app will fetch the word's information from the API and display it in the word container.
3. Display Meaning: Click on the Definition, Synonym, or Example button to view the corresponding meaning of the word in the meaning container.
4. Error Handling: If the entered word is not found in the API, an error message will be displayed.

### Conclusion
The Vanilla JS Dictionary App is a straightforward and user-friendly web application that allows users to search for word definitions, phonetics, and audio pronunciations.
