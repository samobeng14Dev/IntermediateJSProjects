# Random Color Generator Documentation

## Overview
The Random Color Generator is a web application that generates random hexadecimal color codes. It allows the user to generate a new color by clicking a button and copy the generated color code to the clipboard by clicking on the displayed color.

## Features
The Random Color Generator offers the following features:

1. **Random Color Generation**: The app generates a random hexadecimal color code by combining six random values from the `hex` array. Each value represents a digit or letter in the hexadecimal system.

2. **Color Display**: The generated color code is displayed in a text format, following the "#" symbol. The color code is also used to set the background color of the web page to the generated color.

3. **Button Interaction**: Clicking the "Generate Color" button triggers the generation of a new random color. The generated color code and background color are updated accordingly.

4. **Color Copy**: Clicking on the displayed color code copies it to the clipboard using the `navigator.clipboard` API. If the copying is successful, a message briefly appears to indicate that the color code has been copied. In case of an error during copying, an error message is displayed.

## Usage
To use the Random Color Generator, follow these steps:

1. Open the Random Color Generator in a web browser.

2. Click the "Generate Color" button. A new random color code will be generated and displayed in the format "#XXXXXX", where each X represents a hexadecimal digit or letter.

3. The background color of the web page will change to the generated color.

4. Click on the displayed color code. The color code will be copied to the clipboard.

5. If the copying is successful, a message will briefly appear indicating that the color code has been copied.

6. Paste the copied color code into any desired location using the appropriate keyboard shortcut or context menu option.

7. Repeat steps 2-6 to generate and copy different random color codes as needed.

## Customization
The Random Color Generator can be customized in the following ways:

- **Color Options**: The `hex` array contains the available hexadecimal digits and letters used to generate the random color codes. You can modify this array to customize the set of available characters. For example, you can add or remove specific digits or letters to influence the generated color range.

- **Styling and Layout**: You can modify the HTML classes and CSS styles to customize the visual appearance of the app according to your preferences.
